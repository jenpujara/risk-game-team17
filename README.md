RISK game

Risk is a strategy board game for two to six players.

Maps can be Created/Loaded as per player's choice.

Distribution of armies takes place based on the control value of that country and every player gets turn to allocate their amry in Round Robin Fashion.

There are 3 phases in the game:
 - Reinforcement ( allocate armies )
 - Attack ( attack the neighbouring countries in order to conquer that territory )
 - Fortification ( to move armies from one territory to other as per player's strategy ) 
 
After every successful attack by a player he/she gets Bonus Card which he/she can trade-in for getting more armies.

The main goal for the game is to conquer all the territories present on that map and in doing so, eliminate the other players.
